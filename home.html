	<!-- <h1>ASP</h1> -->

	<p>ASP development is part of the PhD project of <a href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/rpg/cr519/">Caroline Rizzi Raymundo</a>. It is based on the biological functioning of <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html">Pavlovian Conditioning</a>, where associative learning is induced by pairing conditioned and unconditioned stimuli. We intend to continue this work by incorporating to ASP aspects of emotional states, in an attempt to generate artificial emotional memory with environmental context.</p>

	<p>We have evaluated ASP by means of 2 experiments. The first has been based on Pavlovâ€™s dog example, in which the conditioning process is very simple and requires a one-to-one stimulus association. With this experiment, we can evaluate the robot's behaviour during all conditioning phases.</p>

	<p>The second experiment, on the other hand, consists in a more complex associative learning, where conditioning involves the association of multiple stimuli. It has been divided in two scenarios, with different obstacle arrangements. The first scenario is simple and presents low chances of trapping the robot during its exploration, so that we can evaluate the ASP's influence in an isolated manner, without noises from unrelated factors. The second scenario, by contrast, has been designed to evaluate the ASP's contribution in a challenge environment.</p>
