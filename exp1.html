	<h1>Simple Association Example</h1>

	<p>In this experiment, the robot is trained to recognize and avoid obstacles using the input from its touch sensors. The robot also receives input from the keyboard, but initially it has no influence in the robot’s decision-making process. Through ASP, the robot is expected to gradually associate collision with the keyboard input at runtime, and learn to reduce speed whenever a key is pressed, even if no collision is detected.</p>

	<p>The video below is divided in five phases of the conditioning process, each lasting one minute. The phases are:</p>

	<p>
	<table style="border-top-style:solid; border-bottom-style:solid;">
		<tr><td colspan="3">
			<table style="border-bottom-style:solid;">
				<tr>
					<td width="10%"><b>Minute</b></td>
					<td width="30%"><b>Phase</b></td>
					<td><b>Procedure</b></td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</td></tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="10%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">1</td>
			<td width="30%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">Before Association</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px; text-align:left;">The key is pressed for 3 seconds every 10 seconds.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="10%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">2</td>
			<td width="30%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">During Association</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px; text-align:left;">The key is pressed whenever a collision is detected.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="10%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">3</td>
			<td width="30%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">After Association</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px; text-align:left;">The key is pressed for 3 seconds every 10 seconds and whenever a collision is detected.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="10%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">4</td>
			<td width="30%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">During Dissociation</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px; text-align:left;">The key is never pressed.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td width="10%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">5</td>
			<td width="30%" style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px;">After Dissociation</td>
			<td style="vertical-align:middle; padding:10px; text-align:left;">The key is pressed 3 seconds every 10 seconds if no collision is detected.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	</p>

	<p>After the associative process, the robot is expected to reduce its speed whenever we press a key, even when there is no obstacle around. After dissociation, the robot should return to act as before the association, i.e., ignoring the key input. Although subtle, it is possible to observe in the video, in the third minute, the moments when the robot lowers its speed under the influence of the keyboard input.</p>

	<p>The graphics below show the variation of the robot's speed overtime (the speed sum of the two wheels overtime). They present, respectively, the results for the first, third and fifth minutes only (before association, after association and after dissociation, respectively), which are the most important phases for comparing the associative learning outcome. Solid areas represent moments when the key was pressed, while hatched areas indicate moments when at least one touch sensor detected collision.</p>

	<p>The first graphic clearly shows that, before association, the robot reacts only to the sensors’ indication of collision. But after association (second graphic), it starts to react to the key pressing too. Note, in the second graphic, that the robot’s speed decreases in the beginning of all solid areas (when the key is pressed), and increases again in the end of solid areas (when the key is released), meaning that the robot slows down during the whole period in which the key is being pressed. As expected, in the phase after dissociation (third graphic) the robot forgets the association made and returns to ignore the keyboard input.</p>
