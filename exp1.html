	<h1>Simple Association Example</h1>

	<p>In this experiment, the robot is trained to recognize and avoid obstacles using the input from its touch sensors. The robot also receives input from the keyboard, but initially it has no influence in the robotâ€™s decision-making process. Through ASP, the robot is expected to gradually associate collision with the keyboard input at runtime, and learn to reduce speed whenever a key is pressed, even if no collision is detected.</p>

	<p>To upload...</p>

	<!-- <p>The videos below show the difference in the robot's reaction as we increase the <i>association rate</i> (AR), which is the rate at which the robot learns to associate or dissociate a given pair of stimuli. Therefore, the robot should bump into the walls less frequently as we increase the AR. The first video depicts the robot under AR 0.0 (that is, ASP is not being used), and we gradually increase the AR along the next videos up to AR 1.0, which is the maximum value.</p>
